# About Me:

Hey there! üëã I'm **Pablo**, a passionate and driven **Data Science Engineering** student with a deep curiosity for the world of **finance** and **machine learning**. My mission is to combine my knowledge of data science with my love for the financial markets to learn.

üî≠ **Currently on a mission:**  
I‚Äôm working hard to build my first real-world project that integrates **machine learning** and **finance**. I want to dive into predictive models, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic trading to explore how data science is used in the financial industry.

üå± **What I‚Äôm learning right now:**

- **SQL**: Sharpening my skills to work with relational databases and optimize queries for handling big data.  
- **Order Flow Analysis**: Exploring how the market‚Äôs order flow and trades impact price movement, and how this can be leveraged for trading strategies.  
- **Financial Knowledge**: From **technical analysis** to **financial modeling**, I'm constantly learning how to apply data science techniques to the world of finance. I‚Äôm diving deep into financial metrics, market indicators, and trading psychology.  
- **Tools & Tech**: Enhancing my knowledge of **Python**, **R**, and financial libraries like **TA-Lib**, **Backtrader**, and **QuantConnect**.

üíª **What I‚Äôm building:**  
I‚Äôm currently working on projects that explore the intersection of **data science** and **finance**. Some ideas include:

- **Predictive Stock Models** using machine learning and stochastic methods to forecast stock prices and trends.  
- **Funded Account**: Challenge myself to get funded account and polish my trading skill (mostly with Technical Analysis).
- **Data Science Projects**: Side projects which reinforce the college journey.

üåê **Why finance & ML?**  
I believe the power of data can transform the way we approach **financial markets**. From predicting price movements to improving portfolio management, data-driven decisions are the future of **trading** and **investing**. By combining **machine learning** and **data analysis**, I‚Äôm working towards bridging this gap and making finance more accessible and understandable.

üåÄ **Fun Facts:**

- **Table Tennis**: I‚Äôve been smashing it for almost **13 years**. and counting.  
- **Running**: There‚Äôs nothing like a good run to clear my mind and boost my creativity. 
- **Books**: I live for a good book! From finance-related reads to self-improvement. Reading is one of my greatest passions.
- **Always learning**: I‚Äôm a lifelong learner‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a new programming language, a fresh take on trading, or a concept in machine learning, I‚Äôm constantly evolving and growing.
